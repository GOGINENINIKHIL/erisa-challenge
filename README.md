üöÄ Core Features
This application provides a robust set of tools for claims analysts, built for speed and efficiency.

üîê Secure User Authentication: A complete registration and login system ensures that all actions are secure and tied to a specific user. The session ends on the browser close for enhanced security.

üìä Dynamic Claims Dashboard: A high-level dashboard provides key statistics, including the total number of flagged claims and the average underpayment amount across the entire dataset.

‚ö° Live Search & Filtering: The main claims list features a powerful live search that filters by insurer name and claim status as you type, updating the results instantly without page reloads.

üìÑ HTMX-Powered Detail View: Clicking on any claim fetches and displays a detailed information panel inline, preserving the user's context and scroll position.

‚úçÔ∏è User-Specific Annotations: Logged-in users can add timestamped notes to any claim. Notes created by admin users are specially marked for easy identification.

üö© Claim Flagging: Users can flag claims for review with a single click. The UI provides instant visual feedback by displaying a flag icon on the main list.

üì• Flexible Data Ingestion: A custom Django management command handles loading the initial dataset from CSV files, with support for both overwriting and appending new data.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
This project leverages a modern, server-rendered architecture to deliver a fast and responsive user experience.
